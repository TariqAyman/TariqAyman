<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tariq Ayman</h1>
<p>
Iâ€™m a Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years of experience, driven by a passion for building scalable, high-performance systems. My expertise spans PHP, Node.js, Laravel, Symfony, and MySQL, with a focus on creating reliable, secure, and optimized backend solutions. I thrive in collaborative settings, constantly learning, and adapting to new technologies and methodologies to deliver impactful results.
</p>
<p>
Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work on a diverse range of projects, from complex e-commerce platforms to real-time applications. I specialize in architecting backend systems that can scale seamlessly and perform under pressure. Whether itâ€™s optimizing database queries, implementing RESTful APIs, or building real-time systems with WebSockets, Iâ€™m committed to ensuring that every piece of code I write is efficient, maintainable, and future-proof.
</p>
<p>
I believe that backend engineering is about more than just writing codeâ€”it's about solving problems that have a real-world impact. I take pride in delivering solutions that are not only technically sound but also aligned with business goals. My experience working with Laravel and Symfony frameworks has taught me how to design modular, reusable code that simplifies the development process, while my work with Node.js has honed my skills in asynchronous programming and event-driven architectures.
</p>
<p>
Beyond my technical expertise, I place great value on clean, maintainable code, and Iâ€™ve made it a point to implement best practices such as automated testing, version control, and continuous integration in every project. Iâ€™ve led teams, mentored junior developers, and worked closely with product managers and front-end teams to ensure smooth communication and the successful delivery of projects on time.
</p>
<p>
Iâ€™m excited by the opportunity to solve complex backend problems and deliver solutions that scale, perform, and evolve with the needs of the business. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to enhance user experiences and ensure that the systems I build are not just functional, but also highly optimized and easy to maintain.
</p>
<p>
If youâ€™re looking for a dedicated, results-oriented Senior Backend Engineer who excels at solving tough problems, building scalable systems, and collaborating with teams to deliver outstanding products, Iâ€™m ready to bring my skills and experience to your next project. Letâ€™s build something great together!
